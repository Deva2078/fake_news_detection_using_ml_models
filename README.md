# fake_news_detection_using_ml_models
This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning classification models. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and various classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest to predict whether a given news article is fake or real.
